/***SET RESULTS TO TEXT TO ENSURE FULL OUTPUT******/
/**
NOTE:  This script should be run once prior to a database restore to generate the
appropriate permissions scripts.  Set results to text or to file and save it.

First, you will run the script on the database prior to a restore and retain the output.
Second, restore the database, run the output of first script.
Then run the output of that script again to drop any users.
Finally repair any orphaned users.
